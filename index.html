           <h2>Tom Brady</h2> 
           <p>
               "Tom Brady is one of the best quaterbacks in the National Football League. He has many Superbowl wins playing for the New England Pratiots. He has been regarded as the best quaterback of the century. Besides all of his acomplishemtns on the field, he has been in alot of scruniiny in the pass. Like the deflatable footballs incident.That incident made his team loo like cheaters in the sport world.
               He was suspended for the incident and made his team look unmoral. He also went to court to tesitify to the National Football League commision.With all this scrunitiny and his mother battleing cance, he did not GIVEUP. He didnt make it take his game away or his leadership. His recent superbowl apperance showed it. Coming back in the last minute of the game to go to overtime and succesfully win 
               with the last possesion of the game showed his boldness."</p>

            <p> "ZicoFremont  is very smart and wise. He made his debut in computer science in grade school after succefully entering magnet program.But this was just the begining. After succefully passing the fourth grade, 
                He was put to summer magnet courses where he did not fit in. Well you see while magnet programs are well of for students with advnance knowledge, the students attitude were despicable. Zico started having problems with them that caused friction with the teachers. He was always trying to get attention by singing songs and making fart sounds. This led administrators to release
                Zico out of the Magnet program. When the new school year started, Zico was placed back to regular classes. It played a big urden to Zico because the magnet kids made fun of him which led Zico to beat up a couple of them. The school principle was shock to see Zico one of the best students in the school turining out to be the worst. This led to a teacher praent confrence with options of Zico going to Emotional Handicapped 
                classes. Zico didnt want to be with emotional handicap students so he promised his parents to behave. When the school started to see Zico behave, they enrolled him to Apple jr courses
                which teaches the fundalmentals of apple computers and its functions. Zico liked computers becuase of reader rabbit. It made him behaved and focused on computers till graduation. He was awarded most improve student and computer science award of the year.His love for computers evolved till now where he is with launch code academy. </p>
